# Polkadot Agent Platform

This repository contains a greenfield implementation of an agent-first treasury and job runtime:

- Foundry contracts for account, escrow, policy, strategy registry, and reputation
- A shared service layer exposed through MCP, A2A, and HTTP
- Discovery and indexing scaffolds for later hosted deployment

The `mcp-server` workspace currently uses a JavaScript runtime source tree. There is no parallel TypeScript build step to maintain.

## Local deployment flow

1. Start a local Anvil chain:

```bash
./scripts/start_anvil.sh
```

2. In another terminal, deploy and configure the contract suite:

```bash
./scripts/deploy_contracts.sh
```

3. Export the addresses returned by the deploy script and write a server env file:

```bash
export AGENT_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS=0x...
export ESCROW_CORE_ADDRESS=0x...
export REPUTATION_SBT_ADDRESS=0x...
export TREASURY_POLICY_ADDRESS=0x...
export MOCK_DOT_ADDRESS=0x...
./scripts/write_server_env.sh
```

4. Start the service:

```bash
cd mcp-server
set -a
source .env.local
set +a
npm run start:http
```

The HTTP adapter will use live on-chain reads and signed writes whenever the env file contains a valid RPC URL, signer key, and deployed contract addresses.

The live API now also exposes a push-only SSE stream at `/events` behind the app proxy as `/api/events`.

If you want durable sessions and verifier results, also set:

```bash
REDIS_URL=redis://...
REDIS_NAMESPACE=agent-platform
```

Without `REDIS_URL`, the service falls back to in-memory state for local development.

## Pimlico / ERC-4337 gas sponsorship

The hosted API can now expose a minimal Pimlico-backed gas sponsorship surface when these env vars are set:

```bash
PIMLICO_BUNDLER_URL=https://...
PIMLICO_PAYMASTER_URL=https://...
PIMLICO_ENTRY_POINT=0x...
PIMLICO_SPONSORSHIP_POLICY_ID=...
PIMLICO_CHAIN_ID=...
```

Once configured, the HTTP server exposes:

- `GET /gas/health`
- `GET /gas/capabilities`
- `POST /gas/quote`
- `POST /gas/sponsor`

These endpoints are intended for ERC-4337 user operation quoting and sponsorship. They do not replace the current direct signer flow yet; they add the hosted gas-management path so the platform can evolve toward smart-account execution.

To verify Redis-backed resumability across separate runtimes:

```bash
cd mcp-server
set -a
source .env.local
export REDIS_URL=redis://...
set +a
npm run check:redis
```

That check creates a session in one runtime, verifies it, then loads the same session/result through a second runtime to prove persistence.

## End-to-end local demo

With Anvil running and `mcp-server/.env.local` populated, run:

```bash
cd mcp-server
set -a
source .env.local
set +a
npm run demo:e2e
```

The demo mints mock DOT, deposits into `AgentAccountCore`, creates a funded job, claims it as a worker, submits work, resolves escrow through the verifier role, and checks that payout plus SBT minting completed.

## End-to-end remote demo

To run a real hosted-stack smoke test against the production-like API:

```bash
cd mcp-server
REMOTE_E2E_BASE_URL=https://api.averray.com \
REMOTE_E2E_WALLET=0xFd2EAE2043243fDdD2721C0b42aF1b8284Fd6519 \
npm run demo:e2e:remote
```

That script:

- checks live API health
- creates a unique remote job via `/admin/jobs`
- claims it
- submits work
- runs verification
- confirms the session appears in hosted history

## Render deployment

A starter Render configuration is included at [render.yaml](/Users/pascalkuriger/repo/Polkadot/render.yaml) and a concise deployment checklist lives in [RENDER_DEPLOY.md](/Users/pascalkuriger/repo/Polkadot/mcp-server/RENDER_DEPLOY.md).

The repository now also includes a Ponder indexer workspace:

- Local dev: `npm run dev:indexer`
- Typecheck: `npm run typecheck:indexer`
- Render checklist: [indexer/RENDER_DEPLOY.md](/Users/pascalkuriger/repo/Polkadot/indexer/RENDER_DEPLOY.md)

For ultra-cheap hosted testing, the indexer also supports a low-memory mode via env vars. That mode skips treasury indexing, starts at `latest` for new escrow/reputation events, disables cache, and is intended only to validate viability on very small instances.

The indexer tracks Polkadot Hub TestNet events for:

- `TreasuryPolicy`
- `EscrowCore`
- `ReputationSBT`
- `AgentAccountCore`

## Contract migration note

The foundation extensions for realtime events, terminal reputation slashing, and claim staking change immutable contract storage and events. Existing deployed contract instances should be treated as superseded and redeployed with the updated deploy script before expecting hosted staking/slashing behavior to match this repository.

## VPS operations

The current self-hosted deployment uses an OVH VPS with Docker Compose under `/srv/agent-stack`.

Operational helpers now live in:

- [scripts/ops/backup-postgres.sh](/Users/pascalkuriger/repo/Polkadot/scripts/ops/backup-postgres.sh)
- [scripts/ops/redeploy-backend.sh](/Users/pascalkuriger/repo/Polkadot/scripts/ops/redeploy-backend.sh)
- [VPS_RUNBOOK.md](/Users/pascalkuriger/repo/Polkadot/VPS_RUNBOOK.md)

Typical production-like flows:

```bash
cd /srv/agent-stack/app
./scripts/ops/backup-postgres.sh
./scripts/ops/redeploy-backend.sh
```
