# Production Readiness Checklist

This is the operator-facing gate for promoting Averray from a healthy
testnet deployment into something we can treat like a real production
service. It complements:

- [ASYNC_XCM_STAGING.md](./ASYNC_XCM_STAGING.md) for the current async
  treasury rehearsal flow
- [VPS_RUNBOOK.md](../VPS_RUNBOOK.md) for day-to-day hosting operations
- [MULTISIG_SETUP.md](./MULTISIG_SETUP.md) for owner/pauser control-plane setup
- [AUDIT_PACKAGE.md](./AUDIT_PACKAGE.md) for external review scope and sign-off

If this checklist is not green, the answer is "not ready yet".

---

## 1. Control plane

- [ ] `TreasuryPolicy.owner` is the intended multisig address.
- [ ] `TreasuryPolicy.pauser` is a hot key that only holds pause power.
- [ ] `./scripts/verify_deployment.sh testnet` passes cleanly.
- [ ] Pause and unpause were rehearsed from the pauser key.
- [ ] At least one owner-only admin operation was rehearsed from the multisig.

See [MULTISIG_SETUP.md](./MULTISIG_SETUP.md) for the exact rehearsal flow.

---

## 2. Data durability

- [ ] Latest Postgres backup exists and is restorable.
- [ ] Latest Redis backup exists and is restorable.
- [ ] The monthly restore drill has been run at least once on the current stack shape.

Use:

```bash
./scripts/ops/backup-postgres.sh
./scripts/ops/backup-redis.sh
```

Restore drills are documented in [VPS_RUNBOOK.md](../VPS_RUNBOOK.md).

---

## 3. Hosted service health

- [ ] Public site loads at `https://averray.com/`.
- [ ] Discovery manifest loads at `https://averray.com/.well-known/agent-tools.json`.
- [ ] Operator app loads at `https://app.averray.com/`.
- [ ] API health is green at `https://api.averray.com/health`.
- [ ] Indexer readiness is green at `https://index.averray.com/ready`.
- [ ] Indexer freshness is within the accepted lag budget.
- [ ] When an admin JWT is available, `/admin/status` reports the async XCM
  watcher lane cleanly.

Run:

```bash
./scripts/ops/check-hosted-stack.sh

# Optional: include the async XCM operator lane in the smoke check
ADMIN_JWT='<admin-jwt>' ./scripts/ops/check-hosted-stack.sh

# Component-scoped deploys can skip indexer checks when the indexer was not
# touched, while scheduled/full-stack smoke should keep the default.
CHECK_INDEXER=0 ./scripts/ops/check-hosted-stack.sh
```

---

## 4. Release gate

Before tagging or promoting a serious deployment, run the combined gate:

```bash
./scripts/ops/check-release-readiness.sh testnet
```

What it does:

1. Runs frontend tests.
2. Runs backend tests.
3. Rebuilds the public Astro landing page and syncs it into `site/`.
4. Typechecks the indexer workspace.
5. Verifies the deployed contracts against the manifest for the selected profile.
6. Runs the hosted-stack smoke check. The deploy entrypoint keeps indexer
   checks for indexer/Caddy changes and full smoke-only runs, but skips them
   for unrelated component deploys so an existing indexer outage does not
   falsely mark a backend or frontend deploy as failed.
7. Preserves previously generated frontend/site output across unrelated
   component deploys. Server-local changes are only stashed if the
   fast-forward pull actually cannot proceed with them present.

Useful overrides:

```bash
# If the stack is deliberately paused during an incident rehearsal:
ALLOW_PAUSED=1 ./scripts/ops/check-release-readiness.sh testnet

# If you only want the live hosted checks from a VPS shell:
RUN_FRONTEND_TESTS=0 RUN_BACKEND_TESTS=0 RUN_SITE_BUILD=0 RUN_INDEXER_TYPECHECK=0 \
  ./scripts/ops/check-release-readiness.sh testnet

# If a staging Subscan key is configured and the XCM publisher is part of
# the release candidate:
RUN_SUBSCAN_XCM_VALIDATION=1 ./scripts/ops/check-release-readiness.sh testnet
```

---

## 5. Observability

- [ ] Backend metrics are reachable and, if public, bearer-protected.
- [ ] Backend Sentry is configured for the active environment.
- [ ] Frontend Sentry runtime config is set if browser error reporting is required.
- [ ] Structured logs are visible from the current deploy target.
- [ ] An alert destination is configured for hosted smoke-check failures.
- [ ] [INCIDENT_RESPONSE.md](./INCIDENT_RESPONSE.md) has named on-call ownership.

---

## 6. Product proof before production claims

- [ ] One complete worker loop has been run on the hosted stack:
  discover -> sign in -> preflight -> claim -> submit -> verify -> badge/profile
- [ ] Public discovery, schema, and trust pages reflect the current deployed behavior.
- [ ] Canonical public discovery manifest matches the API mirror.

If any of these drift, external agents will learn the wrong contract.

---

## 7. Mainnet parameter package

- [ ] [MAINNET_PARAMETERS.md](./MAINNET_PARAMETERS.md) is still the intended launch profile.
- [ ] The private mainnet deploy env matches [deployments/mainnet.env.example](../deployments/mainnet.env.example) except for secrets and final addresses.
- [ ] Any deviation from the recommended launch values has been written down and approved before deploy.
- [ ] No operator is relying on the old testnet-friendly defaults from `deploy_contracts.sh`.

---

## 8. Mainnet blockers that still remain

This checklist improves release discipline, but it does not replace:

- external audit sign-off on the mainnet contract set
- the explicit mainnet launch profile in [MAINNET_PARAMETERS.md](./MAINNET_PARAMETERS.md)
- a real, audited strategy adapter path instead of the mock vDOT adapter
- explicit incident ownership and paging

Until those are done, treat the stack as production-like testnet, not
irreversible real-funds infrastructure.

---

## 9. Internal async XCM staging proof

- [ ] One async deposit request has been queued and settled on the hosted stack.
- [ ] One async withdraw request has been queued and settled on the hosted stack.
- [ ] One failure-path async request has been rehearsed honestly.
- [ ] `xcmSettlementWatcher.pendingCount` returns to `0` after the exercise.
- [ ] A report from the current deploy has been captured.

Run:

```bash
API_URL=https://api.averray.com \
ADMIN_JWT='<admin-jwt>' \
REQUEST_ID='<existing-request-id>' \
XCM_CAPTURE_PATH=artifacts/xcm/internal-async-xcm-report.json \
npm run exercise:async-xcm -- --mode observe --status succeeded --settled-assets 5 --settled-shares 5
```

The manual flow for creating the request itself lives in
[ASYNC_XCM_STAGING.md](./ASYNC_XCM_STAGING.md).

---

## 10. Optional external observer validation

- [ ] A staging Subscan key has been exercised against the current
  `subscan_xcm` source adapter.
- [ ] A sanitized validation report has been captured from the current
  staging deploy.
- [ ] `/xcm/outcomes/status` shows `source.type == "subscan_xcm"` for the
  environment being validated.
- [ ] `/xcm/outcomes` is serving the published external feed, not only the
  indexed fallback, when `REQUIRE_PUBLISHED=1` is used.
- [ ] Any response-field drift found during validation has been reflected
  in the adapter before promotion.

Run:

```bash
XCM_SUBSCAN_API_HOST=https://assethub-polkadot.api.subscan.io \
XCM_SUBSCAN_API_KEY=replace-me \
INDEXER_URL=https://index.averray.com \
XCM_CAPTURE_PATH=artifacts/xcm/subscan-validation-report.json \
npm run validate:subscan-xcm -- --require-published
```

---

## 11. Native observer gate

- [ ] [NATIVE_XCM_OBSERVER.md](./NATIVE_XCM_OBSERVER.md) has a completed
  correlation decision for deposit and withdrawal requests.
- [ ] One staged deposit and one staged withdrawal have native Hub/Bifrost
  evidence linked back to the Averray `requestId`.
- [ ] Captured evidence passes
  `npm run validate:native-xcm-evidence -- --file <capture.json>`.
- [ ] Deposit, withdrawal, and failure captures pass
  `npm run check:native-xcm-evidence-pack -- --deposit <deposit.json> --withdraw <withdraw.json> --failure <failure.json>`.
- [ ] Captured evidence was assembled with
  `npm run capture:native-xcm-evidence` or contains the same
  `native-xcm-observer-evidence-v1` fields.
- [ ] The observer cursor survives restart without duplicate settlement.
- [ ] Native observer output agrees with the internal
  `observe -> auto-finalize` staging flow for success and failure cases.
- [ ] Captured evidence is retained for audit and incident review.

Until this is green, Subscan or manual observation can help staging, but the
native observer is not production settlement truth.
