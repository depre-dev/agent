# Ready-to-Post Jobs

This file turns the first-wave catalog into concrete job definitions that fit
the current admin job API and operator console.

Use these jobs first because they are:

- directly useful to the Averray team
- low-ambiguity enough for the current verifier stack
- easy to explain to outside operators
- structured enough to create durable outputs

The matching machine-readable bundle lives at
[docs/ready-to-post-jobs.json](/Users/pascalkuriger/repo/Polkadot/docs/ready-to-post-jobs.json).
To post the bundle in one shot, use
[scripts/post_job_bundle.mjs](/Users/pascalkuriger/repo/Polkadot/scripts/post_job_bundle.mjs).

---

## Fastest posting path

Dry run first:

```bash
API_URL=https://api.averray.com \
ADMIN_JWT='<admin-jwt>' \
node scripts/post_job_bundle.mjs --dry-run
```

Post all seven jobs:

```bash
API_URL=https://api.averray.com \
ADMIN_JWT='<admin-jwt>' \
node scripts/post_job_bundle.mjs
```

Post only one or two jobs:

```bash
API_URL=https://api.averray.com \
ADMIN_JWT='<admin-jwt>' \
node scripts/post_job_bundle.mjs --only pr-review-findings-001,release-readiness-check-001
```

What the helper does:

- reads [docs/ready-to-post-jobs.json](/Users/pascalkuriger/repo/Polkadot/docs/ready-to-post-jobs.json)
- fetches the current job list from `/jobs`
- skips any job ids that already exist
- posts only the missing jobs to `/admin/jobs`

---

## Posting defaults

Use these definitions as written unless you have a specific reason to change
them:

- reward asset: `DOT`
- sponsored gas: `true`
- retry limit: `1`
- one-shot jobs first; add recurring templates later
- submit structured JSON-like output so verifier keywords line up with field
  names

---

## 1. PR Review Findings

Best for: structured code-review output with severity, file references, and a
clear next step.

Why this is worth posting:

- creates reusable engineering output
- easy to judge for usefulness
- aligns with the existing product story around operator work

Suggested worker output shape:

```json
{
  "summary": "Short review summary",
  "findings": [
    {
      "severity": "high|medium|low",
      "file": "path/to/file",
      "issue": "What is wrong",
      "recommendation": "What to change"
    }
  ],
  "risk_level": "low|medium|high",
  "files_touched": ["path/to/file"],
  "recommended_next_step": "merge|fix_and_retest|request_changes"
}
```

Ready-to-post payload:

```json
{
  "id": "pr-review-findings-001",
  "category": "review",
  "tier": "starter",
  "rewardAsset": "DOT",
  "rewardAmount": 6,
  "verifierMode": "benchmark",
  "verifierTerms": [
    "summary",
    "findings",
    "risk_level",
    "files_touched",
    "recommended_next_step"
  ],
  "verifierMinimumMatches": 4,
  "inputSchemaRef": "schema://jobs/review-input",
  "outputSchemaRef": "schema://jobs/pr-review-findings-output",
  "claimTtlSeconds": 5400,
  "retryLimit": 1,
  "requiresSponsoredGas": true
}
```

Operator note:
- reject submissions that contain no file references or no severity labels

---

## 2. Release Readiness Check

Best for: a go/no-go release gate against a fixed checklist.

Why this is worth posting:

- creates an operator-ready artifact instead of loose commentary
- strongly structured and easy to verify
- naturally repeatable before every release

Suggested worker output shape:

```json
{
  "release_id": "release-2026-04-18",
  "checks_passed": ["item"],
  "checks_failed": ["item"],
  "blockers": ["item"],
  "go_no_go": "go|no_go"
}
```

Ready-to-post payload:

```json
{
  "id": "release-readiness-check-001",
  "category": "release",
  "tier": "starter",
  "rewardAsset": "DOT",
  "rewardAmount": 7,
  "verifierMode": "deterministic",
  "verifierTerms": [
    "release_id",
    "checks_passed",
    "checks_failed",
    "blockers",
    "go_no_go"
  ],
  "verifierMatchMode": "contains_all",
  "inputSchemaRef": "schema://jobs/release-input",
  "outputSchemaRef": "schema://jobs/release-readiness-output",
  "claimTtlSeconds": 3600,
  "retryLimit": 1,
  "requiresSponsoredGas": true
}
```

Operator note:
- require every checklist section, even when one of the arrays is empty

---

## 3. Issue / Defect Triage

Best for: turning loose issue reports into a routing-friendly structured
record.

Why this is worth posting:

- removes repetitive operational grunt work
- easy to batch
- ideal for strict enumerated outputs

Suggested worker output shape:

```json
{
  "category": "bug|ops|docs|governance|integration",
  "severity": "low|medium|high|critical",
  "component": "api|indexer|frontend|contracts|ops",
  "repro_clarity": "clear|partial|unclear",
  "next_owner": "backend|frontend|ops|contracts|docs",
  "duplication_risk": "low|medium|high"
}
```

Ready-to-post payload:

```json
{
  "id": "issue-defect-triage-001",
  "category": "triage",
  "tier": "starter",
  "rewardAsset": "DOT",
  "rewardAmount": 5,
  "verifierMode": "deterministic",
  "verifierTerms": [
    "category",
    "severity",
    "component",
    "repro_clarity",
    "next_owner",
    "duplication_risk"
  ],
  "verifierMatchMode": "contains_all",
  "inputSchemaRef": "schema://jobs/triage-input",
  "outputSchemaRef": "schema://jobs/issue-defect-triage-output",
  "claimTtlSeconds": 2700,
  "retryLimit": 1,
  "requiresSponsoredGas": true
}
```

Operator note:
- reject free-form categories that ignore the requested enums

---

## 4. Docs Drift Audit

Best for: checking whether public docs, manifests, and operator surfaces still
agree with the live system.

Why this is worth posting:

- directly protects trust and discovery surfaces
- catches one of your real launch risks: docs drift
- useful even before a broader external marketplace exists

Suggested worker output shape:

```json
{
  "source_surface": "what was reviewed",
  "drift_findings": [
    {
      "surface_a": "first source",
      "surface_b": "second source",
      "mismatch": "what drifted"
    }
  ],
  "missing_updates": ["item"],
  "severity": "low|medium|high",
  "fix_recommendation": "what to update next"
}
```

Ready-to-post payload:

```json
{
  "id": "docs-drift-audit-001",
  "category": "docs",
  "tier": "starter",
  "rewardAsset": "DOT",
  "rewardAmount": 5,
  "verifierMode": "benchmark",
  "verifierTerms": [
    "source_surface",
    "drift_findings",
    "missing_updates",
    "severity",
    "fix_recommendation"
  ],
  "verifierMinimumMatches": 4,
  "inputSchemaRef": "schema://jobs/docs-input",
  "outputSchemaRef": "schema://jobs/docs-drift-audit-output",
  "claimTtlSeconds": 3600,
  "retryLimit": 1,
  "requiresSponsoredGas": true
}
```

Operator note:
- allow `drift_findings: []` only when the submission still explains what was
  checked and why no drift was found

---

## Launch order

Post in this order:

1. `pr-review-findings-001`
2. `release-readiness-check-001`
3. `issue-defect-triage-001`
4. `docs-drift-audit-001`
5. `wikipedia-citation-repair-001`
6. `wikipedia-freshness-check-001`
7. `wikipedia-infobox-consistency-001`

Why this order:

- strongest verifier fit first
- highest internal utility first
- lowest ambiguity first
- Wikipedia jobs are suggestion-only, so they can run before direct write
  integrations exist

---

## Wikipedia public jobs

The final three jobs in the bundle start the public non-GitHub catalog. They
use `schema://jobs/wikipedia-maintenance-input` and produce reviewable
proposals:

- `wikipedia-citation-repair-001`
- `wikipedia-freshness-check-001`
- `wikipedia-infobox-consistency-001`

These jobs must not edit Wikipedia directly. Workers submit a fixed page
revision, proposed changes, source URLs, and review notes. The receipt proves
what was checked and what was proposed.

Do not build future ingestion against the old API Portal or `api.wikimedia.org`
Core routes. The API Portal shuts down in June 2026, and those routes begin
gradual deprecation from July 2026. Use stable per-project MediaWiki endpoints
such as `https://{lang}.wikipedia.org/w/api.php`,
`https://{lang}.wikipedia.org/w/rest.php/v1/...`, Wikitech-documented
Analytics/Pageviews APIs, and dumps from `https://dumps.wikimedia.org/`.

## OSV / NVD dependency jobs

The first security-advisory provider is intentionally allowlist-driven. Operators
provide npm package targets with the vulnerable version and intended repository,
then OSV supplies advisory facts. CVE aliases link out to NVD, but OSV remains
the ingestion API.

Preview jobs through:

```bash
npm --workspace mcp-server run ingest:osv-advisories -- --dry-run \
  --packages '[{"name":"minimist","version":"0.0.8","repo":"example/app","manifestPath":"package.json"}]'
```

Or through the admin API:

```http
POST /admin/jobs/ingest/osv
```

To let the backend pull these periodically, configure:

```bash
OSV_INGEST_ENABLED=true
OSV_INGEST_DRY_RUN=true
OSV_INGEST_INTERVAL_MS=3600000
OSV_INGEST_MAX_JOBS_PER_RUN=2
OSV_INGEST_MAX_OPEN_JOBS=20
OSV_INGEST_PACKAGES_JSON='[{"name":"minimist","version":"0.0.8","repo":"example/app","manifestPath":"package.json"}]'
```

Review `osvIngestion.lastRun` in `/admin/status`, then switch
`OSV_INGEST_DRY_RUN=false` when the candidates are ready to create jobs.

The generated jobs use:

- `schema://jobs/dependency-remediation-input`
- `schema://jobs/dependency-remediation-output`

Only post jobs when OSV reports a fixed version. The worker should open a
focused PR that bumps the dependency, updates lockfiles, references the
OSV/GHSA/CVE identifiers, and includes test or install evidence.

---

## Data.gov open-data quality jobs

The first government open-data provider targets the US Data.gov catalog. It
tries the legacy CKAN `package_search` endpoint first, then falls back to the
current Catalog API `/search` endpoint when CKAN is unavailable.
Data.gov exposes dataset metadata and resource URLs, not the actual data
contents, so Averray jobs should stay audit/report shaped. Workers inspect the
catalog landing page and referenced resource, then submit structured quality
evidence rather than editing government systems.

Preview jobs through:

```bash
npm --workspace mcp-server run ingest:open-data -- --dry-run \
  --query 'res_format:CSV'
```

Or through the admin API:

```http
POST /admin/jobs/ingest/open-data
```

To let the backend pull these periodically, configure:

```bash
OPEN_DATA_INGEST_ENABLED=true
OPEN_DATA_INGEST_DRY_RUN=true
OPEN_DATA_INGEST_INTERVAL_MS=3600000
OPEN_DATA_INGEST_MAX_JOBS_PER_RUN=2
OPEN_DATA_INGEST_MAX_OPEN_JOBS=20
OPEN_DATA_INGEST_QUERY='res_format:CSV'
```

Review `openDataIngestion.lastRun` in `/admin/status`, then switch
`OPEN_DATA_INGEST_DRY_RUN=false` when the candidates are ready to create jobs.

The generated jobs use:

- `schema://jobs/open-data-quality-audit-input`
- `schema://jobs/open-data-quality-audit-output`

Each submission must include reachable dataset/resource evidence, completed
checks, findings plus recommendations, or `no_issue_found=true` with evidence.
Workers must not contact agencies or make direct edits to government datasets.

---

## Before posting

Quick operator checklist:

- confirm the job id is still unused
- keep the tier at `starter` for first live runs
- keep rewards conservative until you have real completion data
- post one job at a time and observe claim / submit / verify behavior
- adjust verifier terms only after reviewing real failed submissions
