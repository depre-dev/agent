# Audit Package

A single document for external auditors. Everything needed to evaluate the
system lives either here or at the paths cited — no "ask us" deliverables.

---

## 1. Scope

**In scope** (Solidity):

- [`contracts/TreasuryPolicy.sol`](../contracts/TreasuryPolicy.sol) — central admin config + pause
- [`contracts/AgentAccountCore.sol`](../contracts/AgentAccountCore.sol) — per-account balance, collateral, job stake, borrow/debt
- [`contracts/EscrowCore.sol`](../contracts/EscrowCore.sol) — job lifecycle, milestone + dispute flow
- [`contracts/ReputationSBT.sol`](../contracts/ReputationSBT.sol) — non-transferable reputation badges
- [`contracts/StrategyAdapterRegistry.sol`](../contracts/StrategyAdapterRegistry.sol) — strategy registration
- [`contracts/lib/ReentrancyGuard.sol`](../contracts/lib/ReentrancyGuard.sol) — vendored non-reentrant modifier
- [`contracts/lib/SafeTransfer.sol`](../contracts/lib/SafeTransfer.sol) — SafeERC20-style transfer helpers
- [`contracts/interfaces/IStrategyAdapter.sol`](../contracts/interfaces/IStrategyAdapter.sol)

Solidity version: **0.8.24** (via [foundry.toml](../foundry.toml)). No
external libraries beyond the two files under `contracts/lib/`.

**In scope** (off-chain, auxiliary — flagged as non-canonical):

- [`mcp-server/src/auth/`](../mcp-server/src/auth) — SIWE + JWT flow,
  capability matrix, route gating, rate-limit primitive
- [`mcp-server/src/core/state-store.js`](../mcp-server/src/core/state-store.js) — Redis/memory backing for nonces, token revocations, rate-limit counters, capability grants, idempotency receipts, claim locks
- [`mcp-server/src/protocols/http/server.js`](../mcp-server/src/protocols/http/server.js) — HTTP adapter, SIWE/JWT endpoints, admin and service-token surfaces, CORS handling

### Off-chain audit attention points

The contracts are the trust anchor; the off-chain layer is a separate
engagement scope (typical web-app pen-test). The items below are the
non-obvious places a reviewer should focus rather than a generic checklist.

1. **SIWE replay and nonce binding**
   ([`siwe.js`](../mcp-server/src/auth/siwe.js),
   [`server.js`](../mcp-server/src/protocols/http/server.js) lines 2453–2539).
   `POST /auth/verify` requires that `consumeNonce(nonce)` returns the same
   wallet that recovered from the signature; the nonce is removed atomically
   at consume time. Worth probing: concurrent submits of the same nonce on
   the Redis backend (Lua/GETDEL semantics), nonce TTL exhaustion under load
   (`AUTH_NONCE_TTL_SECONDS`, default 300s), domain/chain-id pinning
   downgrades, and clock-skew tolerance (±60s on `Issued At` / `Not Before`
   / `Expiration Time`).

2. **JWT validation strictness**
   ([`jwt.js`](../mcp-server/src/auth/jwt.js)). HS256-only, hand-rolled,
   constant-time signature compare. No `kid` field — rotation works by
   accepting any secret in `AUTH_JWT_SECRETS`, so old tokens stay valid
   until natural expiry. No issuer/audience claims enforced. Worth probing:
   `alg: none` and algorithm-confusion attacks (header is parsed before
   signature check; verify the alg/typ guard at line 63 cannot be bypassed),
   token-malformedness handling, and the ±60s `iat`/`exp` skew.

3. **Permissive-mode fallback and admin reach**
   ([`middleware.js`](../mcp-server/src/auth/middleware.js) lines 135–164,
   [`config.js`](../mcp-server/src/auth/config.js)). In `AUTH_MODE=permissive`
   the middleware accepts `?wallet=` with no token; admin/verifier roles are
   re-resolved from `AUTH_ADMIN_WALLETS` / `AUTH_VERIFIER_WALLETS`. Production
   defaults to strict, but the gating depends on `NODE_ENV` and `AUTH_MODE`
   together — verify no production deploy can boot permissive (and that
   `state-store.js` line 837 cannot be bypassed except by the explicit
   `STATE_STORE_ALLOW_MEMORY=1` override).

4. **Service-token capability containment**
   ([`capabilities.js`](../mcp-server/src/auth/capabilities.js) `resolveCapabilities`,
   [`server.js`](../mcp-server/src/protocols/http/server.js) `/admin/service-tokens`
   handlers from line 3720). Service-token claims (`tokenKind: "service"`)
   receive **only** the capabilities from the linked capability grant — no
   base capabilities, no role expansion, no `claims.capabilities` honored.
   Issuance is gated by `assertIssuerCanGrantCapabilities`, so an admin can
   only delegate capabilities they themselves hold. Worth probing: forging
   `serviceToken: false` in claims to inherit base capabilities, grant-cache
   staleness during revoke (15s in-process TTL plus cross-process backstop —
   see `GRANT_CACHE_TTL_MS` in `middleware.js`), and the rotate/revoke flows
   for receipt replay.

5. **State-store availability fail-open**
   ([`state-store.js`](../mcp-server/src/core/state-store.js) `createStateStore`).
   Without `REDIS_URL`, production + strict-auth refuses to boot unless
   `STATE_STORE_ALLOW_MEMORY=1` is explicitly set; memory mode wipes nonces,
   token revocations, rate-limit counters, capability grants, and
   idempotency receipts on every restart. Worth probing: that the env
   override is never enabled on any production deploy
   ([`deployments/mainnet.env.example`](../deployments/mainnet.env.example)),
   and that Redis namespace isolation (`REDIS_NAMESPACE`) prevents
   key collisions across environments.

6. **Rate-limit client identity and proxy trust**
   ([`rate-limit.js`](../mcp-server/src/auth/rate-limit.js) `extractClientKey`).
   When `TRUST_PROXY=true` the rate limiter trusts the first
   `X-Forwarded-For` entry; otherwise it uses the raw socket address. If
   `TRUST_PROXY` is set without a real upstream proxy stripping the header,
   any caller can spoof their identity and exhaust another wallet's quota.
   Verify production has either Caddy or an explicit allowlist of trusted
   forwarders.

7. **Idempotent mutation receipts**
   (`buildMutationRequestHash`, `getIdempotentMutationReplay`,
   `storeIdempotentMutationReceipt` in
   [`server.js`](../mcp-server/src/protocols/http/server.js)). Admin
   write routes use `wallet:idempotencyKey` keys with payload-hash rebinding
   so a replay with a different body returns a conflict rather than the
   cached receipt. Worth probing: cross-wallet collisions, key omission
   (the route accepts missing `idempotencyKey` for non-mutation paths but
   not for sensitive mutations), and TTL-driven receipt expiry vs. token
   lifetime.

8. **CORS allowlist scope**
   ([`server.js`](../mcp-server/src/protocols/http/server.js) lines 1113–1133).
   Preflight responses only emit `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` when the
   request origin is in `httpConfig.allowedOrigins`. Verify the production
   allowlist contains no wildcards and no legacy preview/staging origins
   that could be hijacked.

9. **SSE query-token surface**
   ([`middleware.js`](../mcp-server/src/auth/middleware.js) `allowQueryToken`).
   SSE routes accept `?token=` because EventSource cannot set headers; a
   warning is logged if a query token shows up on a non-SSE route, but the
   token is still verified. Confirm this is the intended behavior and that
   no admin/mutation route is mounted with `allowQueryToken: true`.

10. **Disclosure of secrets via `/admin/status` and event bus**
    Service-token issuance publishes a `service-token.issue` event
    ([`server.js`](../mcp-server/src/protocols/http/server.js) line 3773)
    carrying `subject`, `capabilities`, `scope`, and `tokenExpiresAt` — not
    the token itself. `/admin/service-tokens` GET (`projectGrant`) returns
    `tokenAvailable: false` so listing never re-reveals tokens. The hosted
    service-token proof in
    [`docs/evidence/`](./evidence/) confirms this on the live stack;
    auditors should re-run that proof against their own deploy.

**Out of scope**:

- Frontend (`frontend/`) — no trust boundary; all authorization decisions
  happen server-side or on-chain.
- Indexer (`indexer/`) — Ponder-based; read-only derivation of on-chain state.
- Deployment scripts (`scripts/`) — operator tooling; no runtime trust.
- Pimlico gas-sponsor integration (`mcp-server/src/services/pimlico-*`) —
  feature-flagged, disabled on all current deployments.

## 2. System overview

Three-layer stack:

1. **Solidity contracts** on Polkadot Hub (Ethereum-compatible).
2. **mcp-server** — Node.js service exposing HTTP plus directory-safe MCP
   discovery surfaces. A2A is intentionally out of the public product
   contract until a real protocol endpoint exists. Authenticated via
   Sign-In with Ethereum (EIP-4361) -> HS256 JWT.
3. **Frontend** — vanilla JS served as static files.

A worker's lifecycle:

```
  SIWE sign-in                  On-chain escrow
  ───────────                   ───────────────
   wallet ── POST /auth/nonce ── server ── nonce ─── wallet
   wallet ── signs SIWE msg ─────────────────────
   wallet ── POST /auth/verify ── server (JWT issued)
                                   │
                                   ├── POST /jobs/claim  ── EscrowCore.claimJob
                                   │   └── locks claim stake via AgentAccountCore
                                   ├── POST /jobs/submit ── EscrowCore.submitWork
                                   └── POST /verifier/run ─ EscrowCore.resolveSinglePayout
                                       ├── approved → settles reward + mints SBT badge
                                       └── rejected → opens dispute window
```

Trust boundary: all mutating calls to `EscrowCore` and `AgentAccountCore`
originate from a server-side signer; the `serviceOperators` allowlist on
`TreasuryPolicy` gates privileged cross-contract calls.

---

## 3. Trust model

### Roles

| Role | Identity | Capability |
|---|---|---|
| `owner` | 2-of-3 multisig (native pallet) on mainnet | All admin on `TreasuryPolicy` |
| `pauser` | 1-key hot EOA | Only `setPaused(bool)` |
| `serviceOperators` | `EscrowCore`, `AgentAccountCore` contract addresses; server signer optional | Privileged reserve/release/settle calls on `AgentAccountCore`; `recordOutflow` on `TreasuryPolicy` |
| `verifiers` | Designated EOA(s) configured by owner | `resolveSinglePayout`, `resolveMilestone` |
| `arbitrators` | Designated EOA(s) | `resolveDispute` |

### Trust assumptions

- **Owner key (multisig)** is honest and available. Loss of 2/3 keys means
  the stack is un-configurable; see [MULTISIG_SETUP.md](MULTISIG_SETUP.md)
  recovery section.
- **Pauser key** is available. Its only power is pausing; compromise lets
  an attacker grief by pausing but cannot drain funds.
- **Verifier key** follows the verifier logic honestly. A malicious verifier
  can reject valid work and trigger a dispute; they cannot steal funds.
- **ERC20 tokens** on the approved-asset list are well-behaved modulo the
  SafeTransfer wrapping (rebasing tokens are NOT supported; fee-on-transfer
  tokens are NOT supported).

### Adversary model

We expect auditors to consider:

- Worker races / double-claim attempts on a single job.
- Poster-side griefing (e.g., funding then cancelling, interfering with
  milestone settlement).
- Verifier collusion with poster or worker.
- Reentrancy via malicious ERC20 hooks (guarded by `ReentrancyGuard` but
  please test adversarial token contracts).
- Unauthorized operator / verifier / arbitrator registration.
- Pause bypass or state-machine desync between pause and unpause.

---

## 4. Key invariants

In the order we'd like auditors to break:

1. **Funds are never double-spent.** `settleReservedTo` decrements
   `position.reserved` before transferring; `settlementExecuted[jobId][key]`
   is set before settlement to prevent replay.
2. **Claim stake cannot exit the system without resolution.** Every path
   that decrements `jobStakeLocked` either releases to liquid
   (`releaseJobStake`) or slashes (`slashJobStake`).
3. **Borrow capacity respects `minimumCollateralRatioBps`.** `_isHealthy`
   must reject any operation that would drop collateral ratio below the
   configured minimum.
4. **Reputation is monotonic modulo slashing.** `updateReputation` only
   raises; `slashReputation` only lowers and saturates at zero.
5. **Milestone array is bounded.** `MAX_MILESTONES = 32` enforced in
   `createMilestoneJob` (prevents unbounded loop in `resolveMilestone`).
6. **Pause halts all value movement.** Every mutating function in
   `EscrowCore` and `AgentAccountCore` carries `whenNotPaused`.
7. **Non-re-entrancy.** External calls happen after state mutation
   (CEI ordering); `nonReentrant` modifier guards callbacks from malicious
   tokens.

---

## 5. Known quirks and deliberate choices

- **No proxies, no upgrades.** All five contracts are immutable. v1 ships
  this way deliberately to shrink audit scope. A bug that escapes the audit
  requires a full redeploy + migration, not a proxy upgrade.
- **Pauser has zero admin reach.** Only `setPaused`. Intentional — the hot
  key compromise model is "pause-grief only".
- **`slashJobStake` splits 50/50** between poster and treasury
  (via `recordOutflow`). Not parameterized.
- **Single verifier per job**, verifier chosen by `TreasuryPolicy.verifiers`
  allowlist, not per-job assignment. Multi-verifier consensus is out of scope.
- **Dispute window is 7 days** (`EscrowCore.DISPUTE_WINDOW`). Constant, not
  per-job. Disputed jobs also carry `disputedAt` and can be auto-resolved in
  the worker's favor after the 14-day `ARBITRATOR_SLA`.
- **`IERC20Like` vs full ERC20.** We never call `approve`/`allowance`
  on-chain (the deposit flow expects the EOA to pre-approve). SafeTransfer
  handles tokens that don't return a bool (USDT-style) and tokens that
  return false on failure. We do NOT support:
  - Rebasing tokens (balance drift breaks accounting).
  - Fee-on-transfer tokens (actual received < stated amount).
  - ERC777 / callback tokens with reentrancy hooks (guarded, but
    deliberately not on the approved-asset list).
- **No timelock on admin ops**. Multisig is the only governance layer for
  v1. Auditors may flag this — it's a deliberate trade-off for simplicity;
  timelock is on the v2 roadmap.
- **Claim TTL is per-job** (`claimTtls[jobId]`), set at creation time.
  Claim timeout reopens the job for re-claim after stake slash.
- **State-store fallback**. The off-chain layer refuses to boot in
  production without Redis (see [state-store.js](../mcp-server/src/core/state-store.js)).
  Auditors reviewing the auth flow should be aware that `AUTH_JWT_SECRETS`
  also gates all write-path endpoints via JWT verification.

---

## 6. Deployment parameters

Current testnet on-chain values
([`deployments/testnet.json#parameters`](../deployments/testnet.json)).
The live testnet deliberately runs the same conservative parameter stance
as the intended mainnet deploy, so an auditor reviewing the testnet
contracts is reviewing the parameter values intended for mainnet:

| Parameter | Raw value | Human value | Notes |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| `dailyOutflowCap` | `250_000_000` | 250 USDC | Launch-phase circuit breaker on aggregate daily outflow. |
| `borrowCap` | `25_000_000` | 25 USDC per account | Bridges claim stake; flat (not reputation-weighted). |
| `minimumCollateralRatioBps` | `20_000` | 200% | More conservative than the original 150% testnet stance; no liquidation yet. |
| `defaultClaimStakeBps` | `1_000` | 10% | Fraction of reward locked as worker stake. |
| `onboardingWaiverClaimCount` | `3` | 3 claims | First three claims waive both stake and anti-spam fee. |
| `claimFeeBps` | `200` | 2% | Refundable anti-spam fee on claims past onboarding. |
| `minClaimFee` | `50_000` | 0.05 USDC | Floor on the anti-spam fee. |
| `claimFeeVerifierBps` | `7_000` | 70% | Share of a slashed fee routed to the verifier path. |
| `rejectionSkillPenalty` | `10` | — | Applied on terminal rejection. |
| `rejectionReliabilityPenalty` | `25` | — | Reliability hit is harsher than skill. |
| `disputeLossSkillPenalty` | `35` | — | Applied when the arbitrator sides against the worker. |
| `disputeLossReliabilityPenalty` | `60` | — | Disputed-loss costs more than ordinary rejection. |
| `MAX_MILESTONES` | `32` | — | Constant in `EscrowCore` (bounds the resolveMilestone loop). |
| `DISPUTE_WINDOW` | — | 7 days | Constant in `EscrowCore`. |
| `ARBITRATOR_SLA` | — | 14 days | Constant in `EscrowCore`; gates `autoResolveOnTimeout`. |

USDC raw values use 6 decimals (Polkadot Hub TestNet USDC asset
precompile at `0x0000053900000000000000000000000001200000`). Basis points
are out of 10,000.

These values mirror the recommended mainnet launch profile in
[MAINNET_PARAMETERS.md](./MAINNET_PARAMETERS.md) and the operator env
template in
[deployments/mainnet.env.example](../deployments/mainnet.env.example).
`scripts/deploy_contracts.sh` carries looser fallback constants for
isolated local development; production deploys (`PROFILE=mainnet`) refuse
to proceed unless the outflow cap, borrow cap, collateral ratio,
claim-stake basis points, and slash penalties are all set explicitly at
deploy time.

The backend operator status surface preserves these policy parameters as
exact raw chain strings. Numeric mirrors are only populated when the
value fits JavaScript safe-integer precision, so sentinel values such as
`uint256.max` do not appear as precise decimal numbers in
`/admin/status`.

## 7. How to run the tests

Auditors should be able to reproduce every test green from a clean clone:

```bash
git clone <repo>
cd <repo>
npm install

# Solidity tests
forge test -vv

# Node backend (mcp-server) integration tests
npm --workspace mcp-server test

# Subprocess smoke tests (spin up a real HTTP server; gated by env var).
# The smoke file lives two directories deep, which the workspace test script
# does not currently glob into, so invoke it directly:
RUN_HTTP_SMOKE=1 node --test mcp-server/src/protocols/http/server.smoke.test.js

# Operator-app guard tests (structured-submission gating)
npm run test:app
```

Expected counts at the time this doc was last refreshed (2026-05-17):

- Foundry: **97** tests across 8 suites (`AgentAccountAsyncStrategy`,
  `AgentPlatform`, `Hardening`, `Rc1Backbone`, `SendToAgent`, `XcmVdotAdapter`,
  `XcmWrapper`, `strategies/MockVDotAdapter`). Covers core lifecycle, claim
  stake, milestone/dispute, async strategy accounting, XCM dispatch/wrapper,
  Rc1 verifier authorization and disclosure, and the mock vDOT adapter path.
- Node backend (`npm --workspace mcp-server test`): **571** tests across
  `core`, `services`, `jobs`, `blockchain`, `auth`, and `protocols`. Covers
  SIWE/JWT auth, rate limits, state store, HTTP config, event bus, discovery,
  jobs/sessions/recurring, verifier handlers, settlement and XCM observation,
  service tokens, capability and policy surfaces. The HTTP smoke suite is
  gated behind `RUN_HTTP_SMOKE=1` and does not contribute to this count.
- HTTP smoke (opt-in, direct invocation): **40** tests covering admin
  endpoints, validate-submission, sub-jobs, async XCM allocation guards,
  CORS preflight, badge/borrow-capacity surfaces, and rate-limit headers.
  Each test is individually `skip: !RUN_HTTP_SMOKE` so the file no-ops when
  the env var is unset. Use the explicit `node --test` command above to
  invoke the file directly; the workspace test script's bash glob does not
  currently recurse into `src/protocols/http/`, so `RUN_HTTP_SMOKE=1
  npm --workspace mcp-server test` is a no-op today.
- Operator-app guards (`npm run test:app`): **5** tests in
  `app/lib/api/guarded-submit.test.mjs` exercising the structured-submission
  validation gate (valid + invalid responses, malformed payloads, non-
  structured passthrough).

These numbers should be refreshed whenever new tests land. Auditors who want
the full repo-wide suite (root `npm test`) also pick up SDK (`16`), examples
(`22`), indexer API (`19`), and ops scripts (`87`) tests on top of the four
suites above.
